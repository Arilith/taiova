# TAIOVA - The All Including OV Application
is an application which aims to provide users with the best possible realtime information about the public transport in the Netherlands, by providing live positions, punctuality, routes and more!


# KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS ALL OLD/UNTESTED/QUICK CODE! 
This repository contains code from a very early development stage of the application. The current version of R-OV (Taiova)'s source is *NOT* public and is of a way different structure. 

The code in this repositroy is of very poor quality, use this repository only for testing and / or "playing" purposes!
